        <h4>Classic Lasagna</h4>
        <p>This classic three-cheese lasagna with pesto and greens is not only a great way to use up a lot of summer produce you've been hoarding, it also keeps and reheats incredibly well throughout the week.</p>
        <p>The richness of three kinds of cheese – Parmesan, ricotta, and mozzarella – contrasts beautifully with a creamy basil pesto and supple greens in this lasagna. Sautéed mushrooms provide a meatiness that still feels light, and a healthy bit of garlic keeps things lively.</p>
